      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Hello World, my name is <strong>Kenneth Hulett</strong> I am fortunate enough to have recently 
        graduated from Queensborough Community College with a A.A.S for Computer Engineering Technology
        As this recent program I just completed focused a great deal on hardware, I decided to try my 
        hand at programming joining the <a href="https://www2.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/workforce/cuny-techworks/">Cuny TechWorks</a>program.
        I am currently learning Html, CSS, Git, Javascript, C++, React and React Native. I feel these 
        programs combined will help me to excel in the technological field as I continue to pursue my 
        passion for technology! This page will hopefully help you to learn a little more about me.
      </p>

      <h2>Spare Time</h2>

      <p>
       We're all human and have things that we like to do in our spare time (besides catching up on sleep!)
       Family is a big part of my life so most of my photo gallery is dedicated to them! I also
       like to fish (although i haven't been in a while). Stil working on this might change this to 
       something completely different! Taheerh i still need to uncenter everything and rejustify
       the page!! let me know!
      </p>
